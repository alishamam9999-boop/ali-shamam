### Hey, I'm [ALI] 👋 

18 years old. Just finished intermediate.

No fancy credentials. But I study how hedge funds move billions — order flow, market microstructure, institutional footprints. Building mechanical trading systems today. Shifting to algorithms and quant finance tomorrow.

Inspired by Jobs, Musk, and founders who didn't wait for permission. Entrepreneurship runs in my code.

When not reading charts → behind a camera. Cinematography & filmmaking sharpen the same edge. 

*Currently learning:* Python | Algo Trading | Quantitative Methods No backup plan. Just execution. 📈 Markets × Code × Vision
